# Inventory

This is a Visual Studio 2017 project solution writting in C#. Most of the UI is created using Visual Studio's WinForm tools. This application is designed to work with University of Michigan network access. It relies on an Oracle database schema within the network.

My C# code in this branch is located in: Inventory/Inventory/Forms/
